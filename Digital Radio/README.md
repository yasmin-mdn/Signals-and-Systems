The input file is 10 seconds of the signal received by the antenna with a sampling rate of 480kHz, which is saved in the form of a text file.
In each line, the value of one sample of the input signal is written
 Your program must first read the input file and receive the desired radio network frequency from the user. You can design a simple user interface to receive the desired frequency. Then, remove the data related to other networks and transfer the desired network content to the range of human hearing using frequency transfer.
 Finally, reduce the sampling rate of the signal to a frequency that can be played by the computer and play it.
The written program must work in real-time and prepare the output with a maximum delay of 200ms. Also, the program should be able to work with other files as well.
